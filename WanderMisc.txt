SYNTAX OF THE .MISC FILE FOR WANDER


     The  _._m_i_s_c file contains all the location‐independent infor‐
     mation to describe a particular "world".

     The file consists of a series  of  sections.   The  sections
     are:

             Introductory message

             Word definitions                                     |

             Pre‐actions

             Post‐actions

             Variables

             Notes

     Any  lines  in the file that begin with a colon, ":" will be
     ignored as comments by _W_a_n_d_e_r_.


INTRODUCTORY MESSAGE

     The introductory message is printed out when wander is first
     run.   It  is not printed out when wander files are switched
     during a run, (possible with the "init" verb  and  the  "w=" |
     result field).                                               |

     The  introductory  message  may  be  any  number of lines in |
     length, (but is limited to a maximum of 4096 characters, set |
     by  BUFSIZE  in wanddef.h), and may contain blank lines, but |
     must not contain a line beginning with a tab or space unless
     the entire message is enclosed in quotes.  If blank space is
     required at the beginning of a line in an unquoted introduc‐
     tory  message use an escaped space, "\ ", to begin the line.
     If you wish to include quote characters in the message  they
     must also be escaped.


WORD DEFINITIONS                                                  |

     Word  definitions  usually  fall  into  two conceptual cate‐ |
     gories, "verbs" and "objects" and will be treated  that  way |
     here although they may be intermingled freely if the result‐ |
     ing confusion is unimportant.  Note that since there may  be |
     any  number  of "words" sections it is common to have a sec‐ |
     tion with the header "words (verbs)"  and  one  with  "words |
     (objects)".                                                  |

WORD (VERB) DEFINITIONS                                           |

     This  section  is  used for defining verbs that have several
     forms which should be equivalent (synonyms).  It is not nec‐
     essary to define verbs that don’t need synonyms, although it
     does no harm to do so.

     The verb synonym section is headed by a  line  containing  a
     horizontal tab followed by the word "words" which is option‐
     ally followed by "verbs" or "(verbs)".

     Verbs are entered one per line, followed by spaces or a  tab
     and  a  number.   This  number is zero, (or omitted), if the
     verb is the primary form, (i.e. the form  that  the  program
     will  use when it prints the verb out for any reason).  Syn‐
     onyms will be folowed by any positive integer.

     Confusing?  For example, if "hit", "strike", "break",  "bat‐
     tle"  and  "attack"  are to be synonyms, with "attack" being
     the preferred form, the following would define them.

     attack  0
     hit     1
     strike  2
     break   3
     battle  97

     Note that "strike," "break," and  "battle"  could  all  have
     been followed by "1" or by "99" and they’d all still be syn‐
     onyms for "attack."


WORD (OBJECT) DEFINITIONS                                         |

     This section is used for defining objects that  either  have |
     synonyms,  or  are to be placed in specific locations at the |
     beginning of the wander, (or being  carried  by  the  person |
     playing).                                                    |

     The object definition section is headed by a line containing |
     a horizontal tab and the word "words" optionally followed by |
     something like "objects" or "(objects)".                     |

     Objects are entered one per line, followed by spaces or tabs |
     and up to three numbers.                                     |
     The first number is zero if the object is the  primary  form |
     or any positive integer if the object is a synonym.          |
     The  second  number  is either the number of the location in |
     which the object is to  appear,  "‐1"  indicating  that  the |
     player  is  already carrying it, or zero to indicate that it |
     is initially nowhere.                                        |
     The third number is a  flag  indicating  "special  handling" |
     when  describing  the object.  It is the sum of any combina‐ |
     tion of the following numbers:                               |
      1  The obj is singular even though it ends with an ’s’      |
      2  The obj is plural even though it doesn’t end with an ’s’ |

      4  The obj already contains an article; so don’t supply one |
      8  The obj is a complete description as is; so don’t use    |
         constructions like "there is a *** here" for it.         |
     16  This form of the obj is to be used ONLY when describing  |
         it in a location, not when being carried, dropped, etc.  |
     Note that 1 and 2 need only rarely be used, e.g. if you have |
     a ’princess’ she will be described as "some princess", as in |
     "there are some princess here",                              |
      unless you specify a 1, but seldom do such examples seem to |
     arise.   Note  also  that  8 usually requires 16, (i.e. 24), |
     whereas 16 doesn’t always require 8.  If you use the 16 code |
     be  sure  that  it is the zeroth synonym and that there is a |
     first synonym following it that can be used for  the  carry‐ |
     ing, dropping, etc. cases.                                   |

     Any omitted number is assumed to be zero.                    |

     For  example, if something called "credit card" is to appear |
     in location 26 and is to have "card" as a synonym, the  fol‐ |
     lowing would be appropriate:                                 |

     credit\ card   0  26                                         |
     card   1                                                     |

     If the object "wallet" is to be carried by the player at the |
     very beginning then it would be defined as:                  |

     wallet   0   ‐1                                              |

     If the object "sword" is going to appear through some action |
     during  the  wander  and will change subtly when it is being |
     carried then it could be defined as:                         |

     sword   0  0  16                                             |
     glowing sword  1                                             |

     Note that the omitted numbers default to zeroes.


PRE‐ACTIONS

     Pre‐actions are global actions that are checked  before  any
     local actions.

     The order of search for matches to user commands is:
         1) pre‐actions (from .misc)
         2) location.state actions (from .wrld)
         3) location base state actions (from .wrld)
         4) post‐actions (from .misc)
         5) built‐in actions (quit, look, shell, etc)

     The  pre‐actions section is headed by a line containing spa‐
     ces or tabs followed by the word "pre", (actually  only  the
     "pr" is checked).

     Each  action takes one line which starts with spaces or tabs

                              ‐ 3 ‐

     and has the same format as actions in the _._w_r_l_d  file,  (see
     ".wrld" documentation for details)

     A typical use might be, in a situation where the credit card
     defined above must be "insert"ed into machines  to  be  used
     and you’d like not to have to check in each location whether
     the user has the card, to include the following:

          insert\ card  o~card  m="You don’t have a credit card." |

     In the case that someone says "insert card"  without  having
     one,  the  above  message will be output and no local action
     will be invoked.  If, on the other hand, the card  is  there
     the  "o~card"  condition  will not be met and searching will
     continue in the local actions.


POST‐ACTIONS

     Post‐actions are used to provide default actions in the case
     that  no  local action is provided for a particular command.
     Their format is the same as pre‐actions  except  that  their
     header  is a line beginning with spaces or tabs and the word
     "post".

     A typical example is to provide a way  of  determining  your
     credit balance at any time.

     balance  o~card  m="You need a credit card to do that!"
     balance  o?card  m="Your account now stands at %6% credits."
     (This  assumes  that variable 6 contains the number of cred‐
     its.)


VARIABLES

     This section contains initializations of  variables  and  is
     also  a  handy  place  to  keep information about the use of
     variables.

     The variables section is headed by a line containing tabs or
     spaces and the word "variables".  The format for the follow‐
     ing lines is:

     variable number <SEP> initial value <SEP> comments.

     For example:

     0           0       number of treasures found
     1           0       number of vampires killed
     2           50      dollars in bank account
     3           0       temp variable used for dice game
     CUR_LOC     3       starting location
     MAX_CARRY   4       maximum number of things that can be carried at once

     Notice the use of the mnemonic names "CUR_LOC" and "MAX_CAR‐

     RY"; these are special, built‐in variables and are described
     further in "Wander.txt".



NOTES

     The notes section is ignored by _W_a_n_d_e_r and is provided as  a
     convenient spot to record such things as reminders of expan‐
     sion plans, etc.

     The notes section is headed by a  line  containing  tabs  or
     spaces and the word "notes".

     Notes  can  also  be  included anywhere in the file in lines
     that begin with ":".
